/*Wrapper component removes issues with displaying the wrong page for a few seconds when page loads.
When no user is signed in, the sign in only pages display before checking if a user is signed in for the redirect to occurr.
This component adds an extra condition (loading) wich prevents the page rendering during unclear user status.*/
