## What is Memoriter?
Memoriter is a digital learning support system. That means: we want to create a program that combines the information storage systems of a note-taking program with the practical advantages of an index card system and thus creates the ultimate "all in one" learning support.
At the beginning we want to create a folder system in which you can create a folder for each of your important topics. Within this folder there should be different index cards to see, similar to "Google Keep". A card index query system is also planned for the first time, in which the index cards can be checked in a similar way to Quizlet. So we want to stand on the shoulders of GIANTS.

## What are our inspirations?
* Quizzes
* Notation
* Google Keep
* Anki

## Planned features
* Calendar system
* AI generated flashcards
